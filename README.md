Hi, 

I'm Kartik.
I'm a grad student at CMU, interested in mathematics and computer science.
I've worked at the intersection of the two through my projects on deep learning ([1](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/DESA-ICML24), [2](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/DeepGenerativeLatents)) machine learning systems ([3](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/AutoGradLanguage)) and theoretical computer science ([4](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/VisualCryptography.git))

During my undergrad at IIT, I also built web-apps that focus on either data-base management and user experience ([5](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/QnAWebsite.git), [6](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/X-clone)) or ML related stuff like a recommendation engine. ([7](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/MovieLensRecommender))

I also like to work on theory -- which ranges from optimization ([8](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/OptimDNN)) to advanced linear algebra ([9](https://github.com/kartiksrinivas007/EE5609-MT))


I'd love to collaborate on systems and ML-infra projects.
